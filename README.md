# 🎉 Nay-gets: Fun & Quirky Widgets Collection

Welcome to **Nay-gets** – a collection of quirky, fun, and useful widgets that I've created for you! Why the name? Well, **Nay** is short for Nayanika, and "gets" is a playful nod to both widgets and "I get you!" So, let's dive in and make the web a bit more fun, shall we? 🚀
